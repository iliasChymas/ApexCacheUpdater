# ApexCacheUpdater
BE SURE THAT U DO NOT HAVE ANY STEAM GAME OPEN WHEN U RUN THIS BECAUSE IT WILL CLOSE THE STEAM CLIENT !
This is a script that checks "https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/t57lgq/apex_legends_on_linux_support_megathread/" for r5apex.dxvk-cache files and it downloads them. then if the downloaded file is bigger than the current shader file it changes it.

# Run
git clone https://github.com/iliasChymas/ApexCacheUpdater.git
cd ApexCacheUpdater
chmod +x cache_graber.sh
./cachegraber.sh
